By declaring a function member as static, you make it independent of any particular object of the class.
A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist 
and the static functions are accessed using only the class name and the scope resolution operator ::


A static member function can only access
 static data member, other static member functions and any other functions from outside the class.
