WRITING raw select query: 
 use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
 
 DB::select('select * from users where id = :id', ['id' => 1]);




TIP For performance:
// Eloquent
    // $this->products is equivalant to writing $this->products()->get(), which has fetched the data.
    // Slower, because data is loaded
 
    // $this->products() is equivalant to writing query, data has not been fetched in this case!
    // Faster, because data is not loaded
