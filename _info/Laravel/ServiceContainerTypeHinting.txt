Thanks to zero configuration resolution,
 we will often type-hint dependencies
  on routes, controllers, event listeners, and elsewhere
   without ever manually interacting with the container.


Laravel's facades and helper functions provide a simple way of utilizing Laravel's services
 without needing to type-hint and resolve contracts out of the service container.
